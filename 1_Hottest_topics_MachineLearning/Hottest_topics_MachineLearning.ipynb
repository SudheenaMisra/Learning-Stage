At each NIPS conference, a large number of research papers are published. Over 50,000 PDF files were automatically downloaded and processed to obtain a dataset on various machine learning techniques. The CSV file contains information on the different NIPS papers that were published from 1987 until 2017 (30 years!). These papers discuss a wide variety of topics in machine learning, from neural networks to optimization methods and many more."

        "The main text analysis method that we will use is latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). LDA is able to perform topic detection on large document sets, determining what the main 'topics' are in a large unlabeled set of texts. A 'topic' is a collection of words that tend to co-occur often. The hypothesis is that LDA might be able to clarify what the different topics in the research titles are. These topics can then be used as a starting point for further analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "LDA does not work directly on text data. First, it is necessary to convert the documents into a simple vector representation. This representation will then be used by LDA to determine the topics. Each entry of a 'document vector' will correspond with the number of times a word occurred in the document. In conclusion, we will convert a list of titles into a list of vectors, all with length equal to the vocabulary. For example, 'Analyzing machine learning trends with neural networks.' would be transformed into [1, 0, 1, ..., 1, 0].\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll then plot the 10 most common words based on the outcome of this operation (the list of document vectors). As a check, these words should also occur in the word cloud."

For now, let's play around with a different number of topics. From there, we can distinguish what each topic is about ('neural networks', 'reinforcement learning', 'kernel methods', 'gaussian processes', etc.)."

        "### The future of machine learning\n",
        "Machine learning has become increasingly popular over the past years. The number of NIPS conference papers has risen exponentially, and people are continuously looking for ways on how they can incorporate machine learning into their products and services.The number of published papers has been rising over the past 10 years! This trend will probably continue for a few more years."
